    The team &#60;| TWD |&#62; has been created in June 2015 on the Quizup game.<br>
    The current leader is VinsGecko &#60;| TWD |&#62; but he's not the creator.
<br><br>
    At the beginning, the team members was just discussing on Quizup. 
    Thereafter, the team showed up on Facebook, Skype and Twitter.
<br><br>
    Our goal is to spread out in countries ranking as many as possible.
    The team is also intended to gather TWD fans and to create virtual relationships .
<br><br>
    Thanks to Facebook, Skype and Twitter, the team members can talk about TWD and share stuff about the TV Show.
<br><br>
    They also can follow the episodes which are downloaded and shared by   VinsGecko &#60;|TWD|&#62;.
<br><br>
    Activities are organised on Facebook and Skype. They allow members to gain XP on Quizup.
